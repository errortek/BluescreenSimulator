## What to do if this is flagged as malware by an AV?

If you receive a notification from Defender or from another AV saying that this is a threat, just put it on the whitelist (in Defender, it's called 'Allowed Threats') - this is not malware<br>
Example of a detection - Detection in Windows Defender:

(Once again, the software is *nothing* to be afraid of, as shown in the Defender screenshot, it's just a 'joke program', so it's nothing serious (not malware!))
